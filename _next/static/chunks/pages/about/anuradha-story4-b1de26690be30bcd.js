Medical Council Act including formation of medical council in every state and disciplinary actions against the delinquent physicians was established in 1956. When a PIL against the flawed medical system was filed in the Supreme Court by “People for Better Treatment” (PBT) in 2000 (W.P. Civil No. 317/2000), it was unraveled that there was no “medical council” in almost half the states and union territories in India 46 years after the enactment of the law. When the Supreme Court sought for list of complaints received by the medical councils over the past 20 years, not a single state medical council was able to provide a complete list of complaints against doctors for the past 20 years. It was discovered that the very few complaints that the medical councils had received over the years, most have kept pending for years without any investigation. A complaint against a doctor filed at the Kerala Medical Council in 1960 was still pending in 2002. In fact, it was observed that in the history of Indian medicine, not a single doctor’s registration has been permanently cancelled. Most medical councils never found any doctor guilty for medical negligence or ethical violation. In the USA, the list of disciplinary actions taken against the errant doctors is renewed is freely available online.
