Despite regular incidence of “medical negligence” in hospitals and nursing homes across India, legal prosecution of the errant doctors and hospitals was virtually non-existent in India when Anuradha became a victim of reckless medical malpractice during a social visit to India in 1998. Being a physician born and raised in India, Kunal was well aware about the seemingly impossible task of bring the doctors who were responsible for the untimely demise of his beloved wife to justice. All of Kunal’s close doctor friends in India were also of the opinion that despite an absolute brazen act of medical negligence that took Anuradha’s life, there is no chance to bring justice for these “top” doctors responsible for Anuradha’s death. Although Anuradha was an India-born naturalized US citizen, the case for medical negligence had to be fought and won at the scene of the alleged crime – the City of Joy where this angelic love story between Kunal and Anuradha started almost 13 years earlier. Even though legal provision for “criminal prosecution” of a doctor causing death of a patient through reckless treatment (“manslaughter”) exists in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for almost 150 years (under IPC Section 304A), not a single registered, allopathic doctor has ever been convicted under this law in the history of Indian medico-legal jurisprudence until 1998. Although not very common, many doctors in the UK and USA have been convicted for “criminal negligence” and spent time in jail for causing death of a patient through reckless therapy. Returning to their dream house in Columbus, all alone in a devastated condition, Kunal started his journey for this almost impossible “crusade” to bring justice not only for his departed wife but also for the countless innocent victims of medical negligence in India. Kunal started this “crusade” for justice against the negligent doctors in Calcutta by contacting the very top medical experts in different countries in the relevant fields (dermatology and pharmacology) for their opinions about Anuradha's treatment because opinions from medical experts play a crucial role for establishing a case of “medical negligence”.
